/**
 * An angular1-like promise api
 *
 * This object implements four methods similar to the
 * [angular 1 promise api](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$q)
 *
 * UI-Router evolved from an angular 1 library to a framework agnostic library.
 * However, some of the `@uirouter/core` code uses these ng1 style APIs to support ng1 style dependency injection.
 *
 * This API provides native ES6 promise support wrapped as a $q-like API.
 * Internally, UI-Router uses this $q object to perform promise operations.
 * The `angular-ui-router` (ui-router for angular 1) uses the $q API provided by angular.
