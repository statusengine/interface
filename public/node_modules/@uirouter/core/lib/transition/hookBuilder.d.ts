 * This class returns applicable TransitionHooks for a specific Transition instance.

 * myTransition.onEnter(...).  The HookBuilder finds matching RegisteredHooks (where the match criteria is
 * determined by the type of hook)
 *
 * The HookBuilder also converts RegisteredHooks objects to TransitionHook objects, which are used to run a Transition.
 *
 * The HookBuilder constructor is given the $transitions service and a Transition instance.  Thus, a HookBuilder
 * instance may only be used for one specific Transition object. (side note: the _treeChanges accessor is private
 * in the Transition class, so we must also provide the Transition's _treeChanges)
