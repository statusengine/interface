/**
 * A basic angular1-like injector api
 *
 * This object implements four methods similar to the
 * [angular 1 dependency injector](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/auto/service/$injector)
 *
 * UI-Router evolved from an angular 1 library to a framework agnostic library.
 * However, some of the `@uirouter/core` code uses these ng1 style APIs to support ng1 style dependency injection.
 *
 * This object provides a naive implementation of a globally scoped dependency injection system.
 * It supports the following DI approaches:
 *
 * ### Function parameter names
 *
 * A function's `.toString()` is called, and the parameter names are parsed.
 * This only works when the parameter names aren't "mangled" by a minifier such as UglifyJS.
 *
 * ```js
 * function injectedFunction(FooService, BarService) {
 *   // FooService and BarService are injected
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Function annotation
 *
 * A function may be annotated with an array of dependency names as the `$inject` property.
 *
 * ```js
 * injectedFunction.$inject = [ 'FooService', 'BarService' ];
 * function injectedFunction(fs, bs) {
 *   // FooService and BarService are injected as fs and bs parameters
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Array notation
 *
 * An array provides the names of the dependencies to inject (as strings).
 * The function is the last element of the array.
 *
 * ```js
 * [ 'FooService', 'BarService', function (fs, bs) {
 *   // FooService and BarService are injected as fs and bs parameters
 * }]
 * ```
 *
 * @type {$InjectorLike}
