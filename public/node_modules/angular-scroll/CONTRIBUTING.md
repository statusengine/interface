Issues

**Please provide clear steps to reproduce your issue**. This is preferably done in a [plunker](http://plnkr.co/), a video or just a link to your project. 

Also nice to include info about your browser environment, version of angular/angular-scroll you are using and other libraries (such as jQuery etc).
