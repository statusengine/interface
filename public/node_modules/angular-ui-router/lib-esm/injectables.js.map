[[$uiRouterProvider]]: The UI-Router instance\n * - [[$stateProvider]]: State registration\n * - [[$transitionsProvider]]: Transition hooks\n * - [[$urlServiceProvider]]: All URL related public APIs\n *\n * - [[$uiViewScrollProvider]]: Disable ui-router view scrolling\n * - [[$urlRouterProvider]]: (deprecated) Url matching rules\n * - [[$urlMatcherFactoryProvider]]: (deprecated) Url parsing config\n *\n * ## **Service** objects\n * #### injectable globally during runtime\n *\n * - [[$uiRouter]]: The UI-Router instance\n * - [[$trace]]: Enable transition trace/debug\n * - [[$transitions]]: Transition hooks\n * - [[$state]]: Imperative state related APIs\n * - [[$stateRegistry]]: State registration\n * - [[$urlService]]: All URL related public APIs\n * - [[$uiRouterGlobals]]: Global variables\n * - [[$uiViewScroll]]: Scroll an element into view\n *\n * - [[$stateParams]]: (deprecated) Global state param values\n * - [[$urlRouter]]: (deprecated) URL synchronization\n * - [[$urlMatcherFactory]]: (deprecated) URL parsing config\n *\n * ## **Per-Transition** objects\n *\n * - These kind of objects are injectable into:\n *   - Resolves ([[Ng1StateDeclaration.resolve]]),\n *   - Transition Hooks ([[TransitionService.onStart]], etc),\n *   - Routed Controllers ([[Ng1ViewDeclaration.controller]])\n *\n * #### Different instances are injected based on the [[Transition]]\n *\n * - [[$transition$]]: The current Transition object\n * - [[$stateParams]]: State param values for pending Transition (deprecated)\n * - Any resolve data defined using [[Ng1StateDeclaration.resolve]]\n *\n * @preferred @publicapi @module injectables\n */ /** */\nimport { StateProvider } from './stateProvider';\nimport {\n  StateService,\n  TransitionService,\n  Transition,\n  UrlRouter,\n  UrlMatcherFactory,\n  StateParams,\n  StateRegistry,\n  UIRouterGlobals,\n  UIRouter,\n  Trace,\n  UrlService,\n} from '@uirouter/core';\nimport { UIViewScrollProvider } from './viewScroll';\nimport { UrlRouterProvider } from './urlRouterProvider';\n\n/**\n * The current (or pending) State Parameters\n *\n * An injectable global **Service Object** which holds the state parameters for the latest **SUCCESSFUL** transition.\n *\n * The values are not updated until *after* a `Transition` successfully completes.\n *\n * **Also:** an injectable **Per-Transition Object** object which holds the pending state parameters for the pending `Transition` currently running.\n *\n * ### Deprecation warning:\n *\n * The value injected for `$stateParams` is different depending on where it is injected.\n *\n * - When injected into an angular service, the object injected is the global **Service Object** with the parameter values for the latest successful `Transition`.\n * - When injected into transition hooks, resolves, or view controllers, the object is the **Per-Transition Object** with the parameter values for the running `Transition`.\n *\n * Because of these confusing details, this service is deprecated.\n *\n * ### Instead of using the global `$stateParams` service object,\n * inject [[$uiRouterGlobals]] and use [[UIRouterGlobals.params]]\n *\n * ```js\n * MyService.$inject = ['$uiRouterGlobals'];\n * function MyService($uiRouterGlobals) {\n *   return {\n *     paramValues: function () {\n *       return $uiRouterGlobals.params;\n *     }\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ### Instead of using the per-transition `$stateParams` object,\n * inject the current `Transition` (as [[$transition$]]) and use [[Transition.params]]\n *\n * ```js\n * MyController.$inject = ['$transition$'];\n * function MyController($transition$) {\n *   var username = $transition$.params().username;\n *   // .. do something with username\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ---\n *\n * This object can be injected into other services.\n *\n * #### Deprecated Example:\n * ```js\n * SomeService.$inject = ['$http', '$stateParams'];\n * function SomeService($http, $stateParams) {\n *   return {\n *     getUser: function() {\n *       return $http.get('/api/users/' + $stateParams.username);\n *     }\n *   }\n * };\n * angular.service('SomeService', SomeService);\n * ```\n * @deprecated\n */\nlet $stateParams: StateParams;\n\n/**\n * Global UI-Router variables\n *\n * The router global state as a **Service Object** (injectable during runtime).\n *\n * This object contains globals such as the current state and current parameter values.\n */\nlet $uiRouterGlobals: UIRouterGlobals;\n\n/**\n * The UI-Router instance\n *\n * The [[UIRouter]] singleton (the router instance) as a **Service Object** (injectable during runtime).\n *\n * This object is the UI-Router singleton instance, created by angular dependency injection during application bootstrap.\n * It has references to the other UI-Router services\n *\n * #### Note: This object is also exposed as [[$uiRouterProvider]] for injection during angular config time.\n */\nlet $uiRouter: UIRouter;\n\n/**\n * The UI-Router instance\n *\n * The [[UIRouter]] singleton (the router instance) as a **Provider Object** (injectable during config phase).\n *\n * This object is the UI-Router singleton instance, created by angular dependency injection during application bootstrap.\n * It has references to the other UI-Router services\n *\n * #### Note: This object is also exposed as [[$uiRouter]] for injection during runtime.\n */\nlet $uiRouterProvider: UIRouter;\n\n/**\n * Transition debug/tracing\n *\n * The [[Trace]] singleton as a **Service Object** (injectable during runtime).\n *\n * Enables or disables Transition tracing which can help to debug issues.\n */\nlet $trace: Trace;\n\n/**\n * The Transition Service\n *\n * The [[TransitionService]] singleton as a **Service Object** (injectable during runtime).\n *\n * This angular service exposes the [[TransitionService]] singleton, which is primarily\n * used to register global transition hooks.\n *\n * #### Note: This object is also exposed as [[$transitionsProvider]] for injection during the config phase.\n */\nlet $transitions: TransitionService;\n\n/**\n * The Transition Service\n *\n * The [[TransitionService]] singleton as a **Provider Object** (injectable during config phase)\n *\n * This angular service exposes the [[TransitionService]] singleton, which is primarily\n * used to register global transition hooks.\n *\n * #### Note: This object is also exposed as [[$transitions]] for injection during runtime.\n */\nlet $transitionsProvider: TransitionService;\n\n/**\n * The current [[Transition]] object\n *\n * The current [[Transition]] object as a **Per-Transition Object** (injectable into Resolve, Hooks, Controllers)\n *\n * This object returns information about the current transition, including:\n *\n * -
